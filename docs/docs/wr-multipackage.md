Currently, the action does **not** support updating multiple packages from one repository.

It will be updated to support multiple packages per repository in the future if there is sufficient demand.

Until then, you can request to add the packages to automation by clicking [here][create-new-pkg-issue].

The automation can update multiple packages from the same repository, if the release for the package identifier can be differentiated by the release name or tag name.
