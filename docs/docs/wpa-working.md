Running automatically on GitHub workflows, this repo has two main components that keep winget packages up-to-date:

## PowerShell scripts

To update manifests of packages in the [Windows Package Manager Community Repository][winget-pkgs-repo], these scripts are executed by a cron job _every hour_.

### [Automation.ps1][automation-ps1]

This script imports the JSON files and check if a new update is available for the package. If yes, it calls [YamlCreate.ps1][yamlcreate-ps1] to update the manifest for the given package, and submits a pull request on the [winget-pkgs][winget-pkgs-repo] repository.

### [YamlCreate.ps1][yamlcreate-ps1]

This is the core part of the automation and is used to create/update the manifest for a package.

:::caution

The script has been taken from the [WinGet Community Repository][winget-pkgs-repo] and modified according to the working environment of the GitHub Actions Runner.

Please don't use this script for creating manifests for WinGet Community Repository.
