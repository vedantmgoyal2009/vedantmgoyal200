    "Message": "Enable module/resource syntax and improve file error reporting (#3186)\n\nThis change adds a new syntax that can be used when referencing resources in a configuration file: `Module/Resource`. This is only added to a new 0.2 schema version, mainly to prevent an issue with older clients failing to run the newer files in a way that is less obvious than \"unrecognized configuration file version\".\r\n\r\nAs part of adding a new schema version, I also added the schema version as a property to the `ConfigurationSet` and `ConfigurationUnit`. This will enable the processor to handle any semantic differences that might arise as schemas evolve.\r\n\r\nFinally, the result from opening a configuration file now contains the field name and value, as well as the line and column number for the error (all values supplied as appropriate).  All of this information is better presented to the user from the family of `winget configure` commands.",
