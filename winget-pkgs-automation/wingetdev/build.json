    "Message": "Act on elevation requirements in majority cases (#2126)\n\nWhen `ElevationRequirement` is set to `elevationProhibited` is set and winget is run elevated, block the installation with an error.\r\n\r\nWhen `elevatesSelf` or `elevationRequired` is set and winget is not run elevated, inform the user that an elevation prompt is expected.  Also in the case of `elevationRequired`, use the `runas` verb on ShellExecute to run the installer elevated.  This can be used on installers that will fail if they are not run elevated.",
