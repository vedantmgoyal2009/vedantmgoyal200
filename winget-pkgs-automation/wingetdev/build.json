    "Message": "Improve configure user experience (#3158)\n\nThis change improves the `configure` user experience by:\r\n1. Ensuring that the configuration file exists before doing any other initialization. This speeds up the time to getting the error dramatically if the file does not exist.\r\n2. Creating a better mechanism to report progress of async activities and using it to give the user information on what is happening during the beginning of the `configure` command.\r\n3. Adding specific error strings for every known configuration error and error source, as well as generic fallbacks.\r\n4. Outputting the result description in the event that it is supplied, and informing the user that there is additional information in the log file in case it is truncated or the `Details` property is not empty.\r\n\r\nIt also logs the entire configuration file input stream to the log in verbose, and improves the progress reporting for the pre-check of the apply flow.\r\n\r\nThe initialization phases are reported as:\r\n- \"Initializing configuration system\" while creating the server process and factory objects.\r\n- \"Reading configuration file\" while parsing the configuration file (this is usually fast enough that you won't see it).\r\n- \"Retrieving configuration details\" while we wait for the detailed information to come in about each configuration unit. This is reported repeatedly any time we are still waiting on more details.",
