It's pretty simple.

1. Use this [link][new-package-issue] or head over to issues tab and click new issue. Make sure you select the "New Package" issue template.

2. Fill in the details of the package. If known, please mention some details of an API/Source/etc. which can be used to fetch the latest version of the package.

3. Submit the issue and wait for the package to be added to the automation.
