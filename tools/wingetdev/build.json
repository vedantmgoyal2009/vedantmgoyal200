    "Message": "Explicit ACLs (#2324)\n\nExplicitly apply ACLs to some locations.  All are consistent with the default owners of these locations (on the current versions of Windows supported).\r\n\r\nThe locations being affected are:\r\n- Temp :: Giving the current user full control (this has affected users in the past if their temp location did not allow Execute)\r\n- SecureSettings :: Admins own and user can read.  This is how it is now, but being explicit.\r\n- LocalState/StandardSettings/UserFileSettings :: Current user owns.  Again, not changed but being explicit.",
