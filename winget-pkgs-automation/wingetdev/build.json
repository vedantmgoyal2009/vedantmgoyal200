    "Message": "Rework extra packaged files mechanism (#3064)\n\nThis change is only to how we pull files into the package for development purposes.  It better uses an `ItemGroup` and properties to enable the addition of files/directories by only adding one additional item, rather than 3 properties, 2 items, 1 message and 1 error.",
